        <p>Sephardic Jews migrated to Latin America and the United States for various reasons, including religious persecution like the reconquista, the reconquista happened becuase after 700 years of muslim rule in spain the spanish people had enough and decided to rebel. This in turn made the conquista and during this and after they said everyone that is not christian/catholic for being a bad person.Another reason is for  economic opportunities</p>
